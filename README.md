+ Project summary: In this project, we used memory-based algorithm and model-based algorithm to do collaborative filtering.
	+ For memory-based algorithm: We use 1) Pearson similarity with no variance weighting to settle down the weight and Weight Threshold to select the neighbors; 2) Mean-Square-Difference with no variance weighting to settle down the weight and Best-n-estimator to select the neighbors; 3) SimRank with no variance weighting to settle down the weight and Combined method to select the neighbors.
	+ For model-based algorithm: XXXXX
Following are result analysis of different combinations of memory based algorithm:
